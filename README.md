Classifying Tweets in Positive,Neutral,Negative in  a Comparative Analysis of Techniques

----Data Preprocessing: 
Tokenization,Stemming,Lemmatization,Punctuation and Stopwords Removal,Bag of words Model (Bow), CounVectorization and TFIDFVectorization, Vectorization based on top ngrams,Word Embeddings Model Using Word2Vec gensim Model,Sentiment analysis and score extraction for every Tweet given 5 valance lexicons.

--Extra Processing: 
Use of SVD(Singular Value Decomposition) for dimensinality reduction, Improving the balance of the Dataset using OverSampling,SubSampling,TomekLinks and SMOTE.
